# CrossCountryClicker
Description:
A small game I made on my free time. This will be updated periodically to include more stuff and clean up code. Don't expect much out of it since I'm not actively working on it anymore.

You can play the game [here](https://darrenwu42.github.io/CrossCountryClicker/).

Update History:
- Version 5 Added tooltips to save and load game icons; on reload, game now automatically loads previously saved game data
- Version 4 Added commas to numbers; added automatic saving; fixed UI bug after loading
- Version 3 Added much needed save and load functions to the game
- Version 2 Optimized JS code; added multipliers for everything you can buy; fixed cycle speed to work properly
- Version 1 First version of the game with basic mechanics and messy code
