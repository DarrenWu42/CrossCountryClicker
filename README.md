Description:
A small game I made on my free time. This will be updated periodically to include more stuff and clean up code.

Update History:
- Version 4 Added commas to numbers, added automatic saving, fixed UI bug after loading
- Version 3 Added a much needed save and load function to the game
- Version 2 Optimized JS code and added multipliers for everything you can buy, fixed cycle speed to work properly
- Version 1 First version of the game with basic mechanics and messy code
